# Calculator-v1.0
A Python programm that creates a simple calculator.

I used Tkinter to create the window, the buttons, the display label and set all their configurations. I made pretty simple (but strong) validations and functions that make the calculator work correctly. I know this calculator can have some problems and missing functionalities so I'll do a new version of this programm soon! I tried to write this code as the cleanest way possible so I hope you understand each line of the programm.

That's all. I hope you like my work, feel free to ask anything you want and use this program as you want.
